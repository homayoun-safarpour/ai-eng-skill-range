# ai-eng-skill-range

**Skills lists are easy to copy; graded proof is not. Fifty-six named skills map to twenty-four offline katas you finish, grade with `skillrange grade` (exit 0/2), and fork into hiring or CI harnesses.**

Each kata BRIEF includes a **Common fail** note so graders stay sharp when someone takes the short path.

## Use this when

| Situation | Use this? |
| --- | --- |
| You want graded practice for eval, RAG, agents, repro, and harness skills | Yes |
| You want a frozen grader (exit 0/2) an org or bot can run | Yes |
| You want a 500-lesson curriculum from math to swarms | No - see other roadmaps; this is a kata range |
| You want a runtime agent framework | No |

## Quickstart

Reliability limits: [docs/RELIABILITY_CARD.md](docs/RELIABILITY_CARD.md).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/homayoun-safarpour/ai-eng-skill-range
cd ai-eng-skill-range
pip install -e ".[dev]"
skillrange list
# attempt a kata: copy starter, edit, grade
cp -r katas/K01-loop-contract/starter /tmp/k01
# edit /tmp/k01 ...
skillrange grade K01 --submission /tmp/k01
# expect exit 2 until the contract headings are complete
skillrange grade K01 --submission katas/K01-loop-contract/fixtures/pass
```

## Skill map and paths

- Full map (56 skills): [`skills/SKILL_MAP.md`](skills/SKILL_MAP.md)
- Interview-core katas: **K01-K16**
- Specialty (eval/trust/harness depth): **K17-K24**
- Companion contract guide: [agent-loop-field-guide](https://github.com/homayoun-safarpour/agent-loop-field-guide)
- Judge ecosystem map: [judge-field-guide](https://github.com/homayoun-safarpour/judge-field-guide)

## How grading works

Each kata ships `grader/run.py` with `grade(submission: Path) -> int` returning **0** (pass) or **2** (fail). CI dogfoods `fixtures/fail` (must exit 2) and `fixtures/pass` (must exit 0). Default path is offline and deterministic - no paid API, no GPU.

## Progress

**24 / 24 katas shipped.** Graded expansion stopped; new katas only when hire-signal gaps appear.
